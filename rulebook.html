		<h3>
		Expertises:
		</h3>
		<p>
		If a character attempts a skill check relating to an expertise that they have, the player rolls a d4 for every level of expertise in addition to their existing check. Before an XP is gained in an expertise, the player must declare the expertise they are going for.
		</p>
		<h4>
		Expertise Types:
		</h4>
		<p>
		There are three types of expertises: mental, physical, and social. Before an experience in an expertise, you and the player must determine which of the three it is.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Combat:
		</h3>
		<p>
		When entering combat, every character must make an initiative check, this will determine turn order. Using a one-handed weapon constitutes a simple action, using a two-handed weapon constitutes an action, and using a heavy weapon constitutes a complex action. The following table shows what can be done on a single turn.
		</p>
				<table>
				<tr>
				<th>
				Move the twice character’s movement speed in meters.
				</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<th>
				Perform a simple action and travel the character’s movement speed in meters.
				</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<th>
				Perform two simple actions and travel half the character’s movement speed in meters.
				</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<th>
				Perform an action and travel half the character’s movement speed in meters.
				</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<th>
				Perform a complex action.
				</th>
				</tr>
				</table>
		<p>
		A simple action can be something like picking up a light object or blowing out a candle (if it is somewhat difficult to do while moving it will be considered an action.) An action can be something like putting on a shirt or lighting a candle. A complex action can be something like unscrewing a screw or washing one’s hands.
		</p>
		<p>
		When attacking, the character must first roll a d20 to hit with the weapon’s accuracy modifier. If this roll yields a value greater than the enemy’s defence, the character must next roll the required dice to determine the amount of damage done. Any expertise the character might have in the weapon is only to be added to the roll to hit.
		</p>
		<h4>
		Weapons:
		</h4>
		<p>
		Every weapon can be described by five values: a range type, a damage type, a size, power, and precision. The following are explanations of each.
		</p>
		<p>
		Range type: Either ranged or melee.
		</p>
		<p>
		Damage type: How does the weapon deal damage? Possible damage types include bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, combustion, energy, heat, and cold.
		</p>
		<p>
		Size: One-handed, two-handed, or heavy. This determines how many actions during a turn using the weapon takes.
		</p>
		<p>
		Power: Added to the roll for damage. If the power of a one-handed weapon is greater than the user’s strength and the user doesn’t have an expertise in the weapon or if the power of a two-handed weapon is greater than 2x the user’s strength, the player must roll with disadvantage to hit. An improvised weapon will generally have a power of -3.
		</p>
		<p>
		Precision: Added to the roll to hit. An improvised weapon of -3.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following are charts used to determine the rolls to hit and for damage of a melee and ranged weapon.
		</p>
				<table>
				<tr>

				<th>1d8+dex+power</th>

				<tr>
				<th>Heavy</th>

				<th>2d20+dex+power</th>
				</tr>
				</table>
				
				<h3>
				Character Deaths:
				</h3>
				<p>
				When a character reaches zero hitpoints they are incapacitated and cannot move or perform any actions, however the character may still speak and see. While the character is incapacitated they must roll a d10 every turn to determine how many hitpoints are lost, once the player reaches their negative total hitpoints they die. If another character successfully performs medical treatment on them, the dying character stabilizes and no longer rolls for damage.
				</p>
				<h3>
				Creating New Classes:
				</h3>
				<p>
				Before creating a new class, in order to make one that works well with ones that have already been made, there are a few guidelines (guidelines, however, are meant to be broken, just make sure you know what you’re doing before breaking one). When buffing character skills, divide up six points as called for by the class (you may want to change that number depending on the amount of expertises given etc.). Generally, a character will start three expertise slots though one can add more or fewer if the class calls for it. Determine which of the three expertise types this class is proficient at (you may want to give more than one, use your own discretion).
