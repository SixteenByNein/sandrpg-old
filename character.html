		<h4>
		Class:
		</h4>
		<p>
		There is no finite list of classes available in SAND; talk with your Game Master if you would like to use a class that has not been previously created. one's class will affect which skills are buffed as well as how many and what kind of expertise one's character can gain more easily. (a list of classes can be found <a href="classes.html">here</a> and directions to creating your own can be found in the <a href="rulebook.html">rulebook</a>.)
		</p>
		<h4>
		Level:
		</h4>
		<p>
		This value will increase as one plays. At the start of a game, one's character’s level will be zero unless otherwise decided by their Game Master.
		</p>
		<h4>
		Archetype:
		</h4>
		<p>
		This determines how one's character will act. Although it has no effect on any mechanics, it is still an important thing to know. (a list of archetypes can be found in “Classes and Archetypes”)
		</p>
		<h4>
		Alignment:
		</h4>
		<p>
		This works the same as any other tabletop RPG -- use the chaotic/lawful, good/evil, system. This, like the archetype, has little to no effect on gameplay mechanics but is still important for the sake of roleplaying.
		</p>

		<h3>
		Traits:
		</h3>
		<div class=desktopimg>
		<img src="images/character/traits.png" alt="An example of traits from the character sheet">
		</div>
		<p>
		Divide Ten points between the seven traits,  
		A trait cannot be higher than four.
		</p>

		</div>
		<h3>
		Skills:
		</h3>
		<p>
		one's skill modifiers are determined by one's trait modifiers. As you can see, most skills are a composite of two traits, this works by adding the two trait values together; if the skill only has one trait, the one trait value is doubled. If a skill is needed but is not found on the list the Game Master may create it as needed.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Features:
		</h3>
		<p>
		Features are to be added as needed. For example if one's character is a superhero, they might have the feature of “can fly” or if one’s character is of an alien race, they might have their species written as a feature.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Expertises:
		</h3>
		<div class=desktopimg>
<img src="images/character/expertises.png" alt="An example of expertises from the character sheet">
		</div>
		<p>
		one's character will have certain experises. The amount and type will depend on one's class (though generally you will start with three). Experises come in three experise types: mental, social, and physical.
		</p>
		<div class=mobileimg>

		</div>
		<h3>
		Hitpoints:
		</h3>
		<p>
		Base hit points are determined by multiplying one's toughness modifier by five and adding ten.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Defense:
		</h3>
		<p>
		One's Defense is Dexterity doubled plus Ten. This determines whether an attack, or otherwise dangerous event lands or not.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Speed:
		</h3>
		<p>
		One's speed is their athleticism modifier multiplied by four. This value determines how many meters one’s character travels in a second or in a single turn during a combat scenario (depending on how the game master chooses to handle combat). In the event of a foot chase, an athletics check should be made.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Initiative:
		</h3>
		<p>
		One’s initiative modifier is a wisdom/dexterity Sum.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Expertises and XP Points:
		</h3>
		<div class=desktopimg>
<img src="images/character/xp.png" alt="An example of xp points from the character sheet">
		</div>
		<p>
		An Expertise gives one an extra d4 on a relevant task.</p>
<p>EX: Basketball expertises gives a d4 when rolling to make a basket</p>

<p>A character is only allowed two levels of expertise along the same branch of the tree of specificity for every five levels.
<p>EX: Sports expertise and Basketball expertise are in the same tree of specificity</p>

<p>In order to gain more Expertises, one must have a number of successful XPs (two XPs for Expertise of an expertise type the character is proficient in and three for one that isn’t).</p>

<p>XPs are gained by successfully completing a relevant task, only one XP can be gained this way per ingame day.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a character may receive an XP point through practice; the player must set aside three ingame hours per ingame day for three ingame days to receive the point, only one experience point can be earned through practice per three days</p>

<p>use the bubbles on the right of the XP points column to record how many you have for a given expertise		</p>
<div class=mobileimg>

<h3>
Leveling Up:
</h3>
<p>
Every Three XPs no matter if they’re in different Expertise levels you up.
Every level a character goes up, they are allowed one point to be given to a skill.
